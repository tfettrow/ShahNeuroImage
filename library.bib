   abstract = {Age-related brain changes likely contribute to mobility impairments, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Current brain measurement approaches (e.g., fMRI, fNIRS, PET) are limited by inability to measure activity from the whole brain during walking. The Mind in Motion Study will use cutting edge, mobile, high-density electroencephalography (EEG). This approach relies upon innovative hardware and software to deliver three-dimensional localization of active cortical and subcortical regions with good spatial and temporal resolution during walking. Our overarching objective is to determine age-related changes in the central neural control of walking and correlate these findings with a comprehensive set of mobility outcomes (clinic-based, complex walking, and community mobility measures). Our hypothesis is that age-related walking deficits are explained in part by the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH). CRUNCH is a well-supported model that describes the over-recruitment of brain regions exhibited by older adults in comparison to young adults, even at low levels of task complexity. CRUNCH also describes the limited brain reserve resources available with aging. These factors cause older adults to quickly reach a ceiling in brain resources when performing tasks of increasing complexity, leading to poor performance. Two hundred older adults and twenty young adults will undergo extensive baseline neuroimaging and walking assessments. Older adults will subsequently be followed for up to three years. Aim 1 will evaluate whether brain activity during actual walking explains mobility decline. Cross sectional and longitudinal designs will be used to study whether poorer walking performance and steeper trajectories of decline are associated with CRUNCH indices. Aim 2 is to harmonize high-density EEG during walking with fNIRS (during actual and imagined walking) and fMRI (during imagined walking). This will allow integration of CRUNCH-related hallmarks of brain activity across neuroimaging modalities, which is expected to lead to more widespread application of study findings. Aim 3 will study central and peripheral mechanisms (e.g., cerebral blood flow, brain regional volumes and connectivity, sensory function) to explain differences in CRUNCH indices during walking. Research performed in the Mind in Motion Study will comprehensively characterize the aging brain during walking for developing new intervention targets.},

   abstract = {This article presents a new high-resolution atlas template of the human, cerebellum and brainstem, based on the anatomy of 20 young healthy individuals. The atlas is spatially unbiased, i.e., the location of each structure is equal to the expected location of that structure across individuals in MNI space, a result that is cross-validated with an independent sample of 16 individuals. At the same time, the new template preserves the anatomical detail of cerebellar structures through a nonlinear atlas generation algorithm. In comparison to current whole-brain templates, it allows for an improved voxel-by-voxel normalization for functional MRI and lesion analysis. Alignment to the template requires that the cerebellum and brainstem are isolated from the surrounding tissue, a process for which an automated algorithm has been developed. Compared to normalization to the MNI whole-brain template, the new method strongly improves the alignment of individual fissures, reducing their spatial spread by 60%, and improves the overlap of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Applied to functional MRI data, the new normalization technique leads to a 5-15% increase in peak t values and in the activated volume in the cerebellar cortex for movement vs. rest contrasts. This indicates that the new template significantly improves the overlap of functionally equivalent cerebellar regions across individuals. The template and software are freely available as an SPM-toolbox, which also allows users to relate the new template to the annotated volumetric (Schmahmann, J.D., Doyon, J., Toga, A., Petrides, M., Evans, A.

   abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity reveals intrinsic, spontaneous networks that elucidate the functional architecture of the human brain. However, valid statistical analysis used to identify such networks must address sources of noise in order to avoid possible confounds such as spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources. We have developed a functional connectivity toolbox Conn (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn) that implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy for physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of movement, and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level estimation of multiple standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) measures, and second-level random-effect analysis for resting state as well as task-related data. Compared to methods that rely on global signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction method allows for interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of the global signal. The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as well as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression analysis for multiple ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity. We describe the methods implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis of fcMRI data, together with examples of use and interscan reliability estimates of all the implemented fcMRI measures. The results indicate that the CompCor method increases the sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree of interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669. ±. 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit.

   abstract = {Brain activity typically increases with increasing working memory (WM) load, regardless of age, before reaching an apparent ceiling. However, older adults exhibit greater brain activity and reach ceiling at lower loads than younger adults, possibly reflecting compensation at lower loads and dysfunction at higher loads. We hypothesized that WM training would bolster neural efficiency, such that the activation peak would shift towards higher memory loads after training. Pre-training, older adults showed greater recruitment of the WM network than younger adults across all loads, with decline at the highest load. Ten days of adaptive training on a verbal WM task improved performance and led to greater brain responsiveness at higher loads for both groups. For older adults the activation peak shifted rightward towards higher loads. Finally, training increased task-related functional connectivity in older adults, both within the WM network and between this task-positive network and the task-negative/default-mode network. These results provide new evidence for functional plasticity with training in older adults and identify a potential signature of improvement at the neural level.},

   abstract = {Neuroimaging data emphasize that older adults often show greater extent of brain activation than younger adults for similar objective levels of difficulty. A possible interpretation of this finding is that older adults need to recruit neuronal resources at lower loads than younger adults, leaving no resources for higher loads, and thus leading to performance decrements [Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis; e.g., Reuter-Lorenz, P. A., & Cappell, K. A. Neurocognitive aging and the compensation hypothesis. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, 177-182, 2008]. The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis leads to the prediction that activation differences between younger and older adults should disappear when task difficulty is made subjectively comparable. In a Sternberg memory search task, this can be achieved by assessing brain activity as a function of load relative to the individual's memory span, which declines with age. Specifically, we hypothesized a nonlinear relationship between load and both performance and brain activity and predicted that asymptotes in the brain activation function should correlate with performance asymptotes (corresponding to working memory span). The results suggest that age differences in brain activation can be largely attributed to individual variations in working memory span. Interestingly, the brain activation data show a sigmoid relationship with load. Results are discussed in terms of Cowan's [Cowan, N.

   abstract = {Background. Aging is often associated with modifications of gait. Recent studies have revealed a strong relationship between gait and executive functions in healthy and pathological aging. We hypothesized that modification of gait due to aging may be related to changes in frontal lobe function. Methods. Fourteen younger (27.0±3.6 years) and 14 older healthy adults (66.0±3.5 years) performed a motor imagery task of gait as well as a matched visual imagery task. Task difficulty was modulated to investigate differential activation for precise control of gait. Task performance was assessed by recording motor imagery latencies, eye movements, and electromyography during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Results. Our results showed that both healthy older and young adults recruited a network of brain regions comprising the bilateral supplementary motor cortex and primary motor cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum, during motor imagery of gait. We observed an age-related increase in brain activity in the right supplementary motor area (BA6), the right orbitofrontal cortex (BA11), and the left dorsolateral frontal cortex (BA10). Activity in the left hippocampus was significantly modulated by task difficulty in the elderly participants. Executive functioning correlated with magnitude of increases in right primary motor cortex (BA4) during the motor imagery task. Conclusions. Besides demonstrating a general overlap in brain regions recruited in young and older participants, this study shows age-related changes in cerebral activation during mental imagery of gait. Our results underscore the importance of executive function (dorsolateral frontal cortex) and spatial navigation or memory function (hippocampus) in gait control in elderly individuals.},

   abstract = {The functional organization of the cerebellum is reflected in large part by the unique afferent and efferent connectivity of the individual cerebellar lobules. This functional diversity on a relatively small spatial scale makes accurate localization methods for human functional imaging and anatomical patient-based research indispensable. Here we present a probabilistic atlas of the cerebellar lobules in the anatomical space defined by the MNI152 template. We separately masked the lobules on T1-weighted MRI scans (1 mm isotropic resolution) of 20 healthy young participants (10 male, 10 female, average age 23.7 yrs). These cerebella were then aligned to the standard or non-linear version of the whole-brain MNI152 template using a number of commonly used normalization algorithms, or to a previously published cerebellum-only template (Diedrichsen, J., 2006. A spatially unbiased atlas template of the human cerebellum. NeuroImage 33, 127-138.). The resulting average overlap was higher for the cerebellum-only template than for any of the whole-brain normalization methods. The probabilistic maps allow for the valid assignment of functional activations to specific cerebellar lobules, while providing a quantitative measure of the uncertainty of such assignments. Furthermore, maximum probability maps derived from these atlases can be used to define regions of interest (ROIs) in functional neuroimaging and neuroanatomical research. The atlas, made freely available online, is compatible with a number of widely used analysis packages. © 2008.},

This study aims to compare the regional and global brain volume patterns associated with gait performances assessed with Timed Up and Go test (TUG) between cognitively healthy individuals (CHI) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Material and methods: A total of 171 (80 CHI, 25 with amnestic MCI [a-MCI] and 66 with non-amnestic MCI [na-MCI]) participants (70.2 ± 4.0 years; 37% female) consecutively realized (rTUG) and imagined (iTUG) the TUG. rTUG measures the time needed to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around and return to a seated position and iTUG represents the validated imagined version of the TUG. Global and regional brain volumes were quantified from three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI using a semi-automated software. Results: Linear regression models show that increased rTUG (i.e. worse performance) was associated with lower total white matter, total gray matter, left and right hippocampal volume in patients with na-MCI (P < 0.045), and with lower right hippocampal volume in CHI (P = 0.013). Increased iTUG was associated with lower gray matter and left premotor cortex volumes in patients with na-MCI (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings showed different patterns of brain volume reduction associated with increased rTUG and iTUG between CHI and MCI patients, except for the right hippocampal volume which was smaller in both groups.},

Design Cross-sectional observational study. Setting University-based research clinic. Participants Forty-five participants aged 70 to 90 (mean 76.3 ± 5.1) volunteered to complete 17 daily activities, each lasting 10 minutes. Measurements Oxygen consumption (VO 2 = mL/kg per minute) was measured through a mask using a portable gas analyzer, and MET values were calculated as measured VO 2/3.5 mL/kg per minute. Values were compared with normative values and between participants with and without mobility impairments. Results Measured METs were different from the established normative criteria in 14 of 17 tasks performed. Normative values underestimated walking leisurely (0.87 ± 0.12 METs) walking briskly (0.87 ± 0.12 METs), and making beds (1.07 ± 0.10 METs) but overestimated gardening (1.46 ± 0.12 METs) and climbing stairs (0.73 ± 0.18). Participants with impairments had significantly lower METs while gardening, vacuuming or sweeping, stair climbing, and walking briskly, although when METs were adjusted for performance speed, the metabolic costs were 16% to 27% higher for those with mobility impairments. Conclusion Metabolic costs of daily activities are substantially different from normative values in older adults, and having mobility impairments increases this metabolic cost.

To test these hypotheses, performance on a bimanual tracking task at 4 complexity levels and associated brain activation were assessed in 3 age groups (20-40, 40-60, and 60-80 years, n = 99). All age groups showed decreased tracking accuracy and increased brain activation with increased task complexity, with larger performance decrements and activation increases in the older age groups.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of impaired vision, peripheral sensation, lower limb muscle strength, reaction time, and balance in a large community-dwelling population of women aged 65 years and over, and to determine whether impaired performances in these tests are associated with falls. DESIGN: One-year prospective study. SETTING: Conducted as part of the Randwick Falls and Fractures Study, in Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred fourteen women aged 65 to 99 years (mean age 73.7 years, SD = 6.3) were randomly selected from the community; 341 of these women were included in the 1-year prospective study. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of impairment in all tests increased with age. In the year following assessment, 207 subjects (60.7%) experienced no falls, 63 subjects (18.5%) fell one time only, and 71 subjects (20.8%) fell on two or more occasions. After controlling for age, multiple falling was associated with low contrast visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, poor vibration sense and proprioception, reduced lower limb strength, slow reaction time, and impaired balance, as indicated by four sway tests and two clinical stability measures. Discriminant function analysis identified visual contrast sensitivity, proprioception in the lower limbs, quadriceps strength, reaction time, and sway on a compliant (foam rubber) surface with the eyes open as the variables that significantly discriminated between subjects who experienced multiple falls and subjects who experienced no falls or one fall only (Wilks' lambda = 0.73 (P < 0.001), canonical correlation = 0.52). This procedure correctly classified 75% of subjects into multiple faller or nonmultiple faller groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support previous results conducted in retirement village and institutional settings and indicate that the test procedure aids in the identification of older community-dwelling women at risk of falls.},

   abstract = {We developed a method for altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill to study gait kinematics. Terrain consisted of rigid polyurethane disks (12.7 cm diameter, 1.3-3.8 cm tall) which attached to the treadmill belt using hook-and-loop fasteners. Here, we tested four terrain unevenness conditions: Flat, Low, Medium, and High. The main objective was to test the hypothesis that increasing the unevenness of the terrain would result in greater gait kinematic variability. Seventeen younger adults (age 20-40 years), 25 higher-functioning older adults (age 65+ years), and 29 lower-functioning older adults (age 65+ years, Short Physical Performance Battery score < 10) participated. We customized the treadmill speed to each participant's walking ability, keeping the speed constant across all four terrain conditions. Participants completed two 3-minute walking trials per condition. Using an inertial measurement unit placed over the sacrum and pressure sensors in the shoes, we calculated the stride-to-stride variability in step duration and sacral excursion (coefficient of variation; standard deviation expressed as percentage of the mean). Participants also self-reported their perceived stability for each condition. Terrain was a significant predictor of step duration variability, which roughly doubled from Flat to High terrain for all participant groups: younger adults (Flat 4.0%, High 8.2%), higher-functioning older adults (Flat 5.0%, High 8.9%), lowerfunctioning older adults (Flat 7.0%, High 14.1%). Similarly, all groups exhibited significant increases in sacral excursion variability for the Medium and High uneven terrain conditions, compared to Flat. Participants were also significantly more likely to report feeling less stable walking over all three uneven terrain conditions compared to Flat. These findings support the hypothesis that altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill will increase gait kinematic variability and reduce perceived stability in younger and older adults.},

   abstract = {The rapid growth of the literature on neuroimaging in humans has led to major advances in our understanding of human brain function but has also made it increasingly difficult to aggregate and synthesize neuroimaging findings. Here we describe and validate an automated brain-mapping framework that uses text-mining, meta-analysis and machine-learning techniques to generate a large database of mappings between neural and cognitive states. We show that our approach can be used to automatically conduct large-scale, high-quality neuroimaging meta-analyses, address long-standing inferential problems in the neuroimaging literature and support accurate 'decoding' of broad cognitive states from brain activity in both entire studies and individual human subjects. Collectively, our results have validated a powerful and generative framework for synthesizing human neuroimaging data on an unprecedented scale. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Despite the growing importance of longitudinal data in neuroimaging, the standard analysis methods make restrictive or unrealistic assumptions (e.g., assumption of Compound Symmetry-the state of all equal variances and equal correlations-or spatially homogeneous longitudinal correlations). While some new methods have been proposed to more accurately account for such data, these methods are based on iterative algorithms that are slow and failure-prone. In this article, we propose the use of the Sandwich Estimator method which first estimates the parameters of interest with a simple Ordinary Least Square model and second estimates variances/covariances with the "so-called" Sandwich Estimator (SwE) which accounts for the within-subject correlation existing in longitudinal data. Here, we introduce the SwE method in its classic form, and we review and propose several adjustments to improve its behaviour, specifically in small samples. We use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to compare all considered adjustments and isolate the best combination for neuroimaging data. We also compare the SwE method to other popular methods and demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we analyse a highly unbalanced longitudinal dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate the flexibility of the SwE method to fit within- and between-subject effects in a single model. Software implementing this SwE method has been made freely available at http://warwick.ac.uk/tenichols/SwE. © 2014.},

@article{Smith2009,
   abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z < 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of “clusters” of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as “threshold-free cluster enhancement” (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},
